# mini_RT
The goal of this project is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

Allowed built-in functions: **open**, **close**, **read**, **write**, **malloc**, **free**, **perror**, **strerror**, **exit**. **All functions of the math library**. **All functions of the MinilibX**.

The task is to, implement 5 geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder, square and triangle.
